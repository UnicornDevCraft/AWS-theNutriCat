PREPARATIONS  

TO SAVE TIME IN THE KITCHEN, YOU MUST PREPARE:  

1) Cook vegetable broth (or use ready-made broth from previous weeks). For the broth, I use one onion, parsley root, carrot, a celery stalk, and favorite seasonings.  
2) Prepare pesto sauce.
3) Prepare Italian marinade:
Mix olive oil, balsamic vinegar, a few rosemary leaves, and 1 clove of crushed garlic. Mix well and store in the fridge.  
4) Prepare Italian salad dressing.
5) Marinate chicken breasts:
First, cut the breasts into small cubes and pour half of the Italian marinade over them.  
6) Prepare tomato sauce:
Sauté 1 onion until golden, add a chopped celery stalk, cover with a lid, and reduce heat. After a couple of minutes, add 250 g of canned tomatoes and 100 ml of tomato juice. Add salt, pepper, and a rosemary sprig. Simmer the sauce under the lid on low heat for 20–25 minutes. Let it cool and transfer to a container. Store in the fridge for up to 7 days.  
7) Prepare peperonata:
Sauté 1 onion until golden, add slices of peppers, cover with a lid, and reduce heat. Simmer for 5 minutes, then add 250 g of canned tomatoes and 100 ml of tomato juice. Simmer under the lid for 15 minutes, then add finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes in oil - 50 g, and 10 g of chopped parsley.
